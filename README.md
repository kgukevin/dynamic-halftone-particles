# Dynamic Halftone Particles
## What does it do?
- Moving particles that bounce off each other are so very satisfying. They present essentially infinite possibilities for patterns and movement behaviors.

- Halftone images are cool renders of images as a matrix of circles with radii corresponding to the brightness value of pixels.

- This projects combines the two -- along with a touch of gravity and perlin noise -- into an artistic representation of your favorite photograph.

## How to use?
 - A default image is loaded but users can load their own by drag n' drop or pressing the o_key to open file explorer.
    - Particles are automatically initialized with initial velocity of zero to create a halftone render of the default image.

- To clear particles, press the delete_key.

- To create/add particles, click or drag the mouse.

- To toggle the color of new particles, press the p_key.

- To set a new center of gravity, hold the shift_key and click or drag the mouse.

- To increase the velocity of particles, press the up_arrow.

- To decrease the velocity of particles, press the down_arrow.
